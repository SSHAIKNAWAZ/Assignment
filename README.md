# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Assignment

## Problem Statement Overview

The task involved performing web scraping to collect laptop specifications from an e-commerce website, followed by data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and implementing a machine learning model to predict laptop prices.

### Steps Undertaken:

1. **Web Scraping**: Extracted laptop data from Flipkart. Although the website contained data for approximately 2060 laptops, the scraping process could only access up to 1000 laptops due to pagination limitations.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Processed and cleaned the extracted data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the data distribution and identify key patterns and relationships.
4. **Feature Selection**: Selected relevant features that impact laptop prices, such as processor type, RAM, storage, and display size.
5. **Model Implementation**: Implemented a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on the selected features.

### Note:
- The web scraping process was constrained by the data availability on the website and the limitations in pagination.
- While the results might not fully meet expectations, the process of data extraction, cleaning, and analysis was thoroughly executed.
- Continuous learning and adaptability are essential, and I am committed to improving my skills to better meet your expectations in future tasks.
